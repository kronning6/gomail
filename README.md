# gomail

gomail is a CLI for Gmail enabling email screening power tools.

## Overview

This project serves two purposes:

1. Create a TUI program to interact with Gmail to provide email screening, making it easier
   to manage an unruly inbox
1. Get more familiar with Go

The future of this project may expand into using AI to help with email screening. It could also
expand into an email screening service, but for now it's focused on being a power tool that needs
to run in a CLI.

## Getting Started

This project was started from: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/go.

To get started, follow the instructions to enable the Gmail API on your account and populate
`credentials.json` from the `credentials-eample.json` file.

To authenticate run `go run main.goi setup`.

## Roadmap

- [x] Get all emails received today
- [ ] Display emails in table using Charm
